# IPFS Redirects Parser

**Experimental**
Parser for the IPFS HTTP Gateway's `_redirects` file format.

Currently this is a subset of Netlify's [redirects format](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/).
The details of the supported functionality are still in flux and will eventually be included in a [spec](https://github.com/ipfs/specs).

## Format
Currently only supports `from`, `to` and `status`.

```
from to [status]
```

## Example

```sh
# Implicit 301 redirects
/home              /
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
/google            https://www.google.com

# Redirect with a 301
/home         /              301

# Redirect with a 302
/my-redirect  /              302

# Rewrite a path
/pass-through /index.html    200

# Show a custom 404 for this path
/ecommerce    /store-closed  404

# Single page app rewrite
/*    /index.html   200

# Proxying
/api/*  https://api.example.com/:splat  200
```
